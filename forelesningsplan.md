|Preparation    |                |We use the open-source programming software R, along with its graphical user interface, RStudio, for all the estimations. We highly recommend you download these onto your personal computer and spend some time acquainting yourself with the RStudio interface. Download R from here, and RStudio from here. Alternatively, you can access R through the Jupyter notebook interface using your web-browser here. Use your UiT username and password.                 |
